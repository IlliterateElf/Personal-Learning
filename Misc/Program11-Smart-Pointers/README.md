>!	Sight of lifeboats

bool BoatsHere()
>!	If no boats here, returns false

**Crew.h**

## Workflow

Steps:
1.	Outlay and understand the project
2.	Create the documentation of possible implementation
3.	Transfer documentation to UML diagram
4.	Code implementation
5.	Revise **(CURRENT)**

TODO:

Fix memory bug
Fix cohesion with public constants

-----------------------------------------

## End-Product

### Directions

The more technical the topic, the harder it is to make a relatable assignment.
Sooo... how about lifeboats on the Titanic.  Except in this version it's in the Caribbean and there are no sharks.  So everyone splashes around for a while and nobody dies.  Then they all go to Papas and Beer.
Classes: Lifeboat that holds a list of Passengers.  Crew that hold a rope (shared_ptrs) to a Lifeboat.  Captain that is looking (weak_ptrs) at all the lifeboats.
At start: Main has a single queue of passengers.  A Passenger has an age and a gender, both are randomized.  The queue starts with 50 of them.  Two Lifeboats exist.  Each have a capacity of 20 and each have two Crew holding on to them with shared pointers.
For each person in line, "Women and children first".  If the Passenger is a woman or less than 10, they get the first boat, or the second if the first is full.  Men try the second boat first, and can only try the first boat if it is their second try (so all women have had a shot).  If you can't get on a boat, get back in the queue.  After someone gets on a boat, there is a 5% chance that one of the Crew will let go of their shared pointer accidentally.  When the Captain (who had weak pointers to the boats) sees the boats are gone, the program ends.
 
Passenger: Gender, Age
Captain: list of weak pointers to Lifeboats
Crew: Strong pointer to Lifeboat
Lifeboat: List of Passenger pointers
Main: Two Lifeboats, queue with 50 Passengers, two Crew per Lifeboat, 1 Captain
 
Main outline
Set up objects
While the queue isn't empty and the captain says there are still boats
   If woman or child
      Try boat 1
   If not in a boat
      Try boat 2
   If still not in a boat
      Back to end of queue
   If someone loaded
      Check if a Crew drops a boat
 
Output:
Lifeboat's destructor should print how many people got on it.  It get destroyed when the last Crew object lets go
After Captain detects all boats are gone, output how many people will be swimming to shore because they were left behind

### Notes

Passengers don't do anything
Captains look on the edge seeing how many lifeboats are left (weak_ptr)
Crew hold lifeboats (shared_ptr) all crew have their own shared_ptr
If guys get to front of line twice let him on boat
When the crew let's go of boat, boat gets deleted
